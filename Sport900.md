### Camille du Gast - \'greatest sportswoman of all time\' {#camille-du-gast---greatest-sportswoman-of-all-time .title}

<div>

Camille du Gast was what might now be known as an adrenaline junkie -
she was a balloonist, parachutist, fencer, tobogganist, skier, rifle
shooter.\
She was the second woman to compete in an international motor race and
the first woman to race consistently at international level.\
The publisher of the New York Herald Gordon Bennett called her 'the
greatest sportswoman of all time'.\
In 1901, Camille was one of two women who competed in the Paris-Berlin
race.\
Camille drove a 20hp Panhard, starting last out of 122 drivers but
finishing 33rd.\
When her motor racing career came to an end in 1904 - because the French
government banned women from taking part in motor sports - she turned
her attention to speed boats.

<div>

Michèle Mouton is a former French rally driver.\
She started rallying in 1973 and started winning French and European
Women's Championship titles soon after.\
In 1981 Michèle and Italian co-driver Fabrizia Pons became the first
women to win a World Championship rally, driving as part of the Audi
team in Sanremo.\
In 2010, Michèle Mouton became the first president of the FIA\'s Women &
Motor Sport Commission.\
In a statement at the time, Michèle said that 'Women already have their
place in motor sport; they have proved it.\
But for many years people have asked me why there have been no women
following in my footsteps.\
I really hope the Commission can help answer that question and that we
can attract and support women in all areas of our sport.'

His father was from Naples, while his mother was of Afro-Argentinian
heritage.\
His professional football career began in Chile, where he played for

### Kathleen McKane Godfree - Champion tennis player in the 1920s {#kathleen-mckane-godfree---champion-tennis-player-in-the-1920s .title}

<div>

Tennis has been a part of the Olympic Games since the first
championships in 1896, albeit with a large break for more than 60 years
while the definition of an amateur player was debated. In all this time,
there are only two tennis players to have won five Olympic medals: Venus
Williams and Kathleen (\'Kitty\') McKane Godfree. Venus Williams\' four
gold and one silver Olympic medals add to her many Grand Slam titles,
confirming her as one of the greatest tennis players of all time.
However, Kathleen McKane Godfree - who played in the 1920s - may be less
well remembered today. Born in 1896 in London, Kitty McKane learned to
play tennis at Saint Leonard\'s School in Scotland. She made her
competitive debut in a tournament in Roehampton in April 1919 and, just
a few weeks later, reached the quarter-finals at Wimbledon. She soon
became Britain\'s number one player. In the 1920 Olympic Games in
Antwerp, she won a gold, silver and bronze medal in the Doubles, Mixed
Doubles and Singles competitions respectively.

### Histories of the Paralympic Games {#histories-of-the-paralympic-games .title}

<div>

When did the Paralympic Games start and what is their history?\
The Paralympic Games now take place every four years, hosted in the same
cities as the Olympic Games. These games - for athletes with
disabilities - take their name from the Greek word παρά, pará, meaning
\'beside\' or \'alongside\', referring to their status alongside the
Olympic Games. While the history of the modern Olympic Games stretches
back to the 19th century, the Paralympic Games (and the disability
sports competitions they developed from) are rooted in the mid-20th
century.

### The Tailteann Games - the Irish Olympics {#the-tailteann-games---the-irish-olympics .title}

<div>

he sporting championships we enjoy now have long, historical roots. The
modern Olympic Games were inspired by the Olympics of ancient Greece,
reviving and valorising competitions from a time before the industrial
and modern world. In Ireland, the Tailteann Games can be seen to follow
a similar path, reviving an ancient sporting tradition in modern times.
The Tailteann Games were a sport championships for Irish people or those
with Irish ancestry. They were held across Ireland in 1924, 1928 and
1932. In these years, Ireland had just won its independence. The
Tailteann Games were seen as a way to establish the new Irish state,
reviving an ancient sporting custom. In Bronze Age Ireland, large
sporting gatherings known as funeral games were held. These were
athletic competitions held to honour a recently deceased person. The
name Tailteann derives from one such event: the Aonach Tailteann (the
Tailtin Fair) held in the townload of Teltown in County Meath. According
to the Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland, the fair was established by the
legendary king Lugh Lámhfhada (reigned 1849 to 1809 BC) in honour of his
foster-mother, Tailtiu.

### Olympic Games {#olympic-games .title}

#### How did sports and rules evolve at the 1920 Olympic Games?

<div>

Travelling back a century in time, things were of course very different
in the summer of 1920. There were, for example, several disciplines
included in the 1920 Olympic Games that no longer take place today, such
as tug of war and equestrian vaulting. An interesting surprise was the
inclusion of art as a separate discipline in the agenda. Like the
athletes participating in the Games, architects, painters, sculptors,
and musicians also had the chance to receive medals with their
sport-inspired artworks. Nowadays, we are used to having the Summer and
Winter Olympics as two separate sports tournaments. But, in 1920, ice
hockey and figure skating were also included in the Antwerp Olympics
alongside all the other summer sports. Taking place at the Ice Palace of
Antwerp, the ice hockey tournament marked the debut of the sport in the
Olympics. It was also the only time this winter sport appeared in a
Summer Games - since 1924, it has been part of the Winter Games. We also
see several rule changes relating to gender. Racewalking, for instance,
used to be reserved only for male athletes. It was not until 1992 that
women were allowed to participate in this sport.
