scandal of *La Femme au Masque* where she was maliciously but mistakenly
named as the nude model in a notorious painting by . This salacious
story involved three court cases, and was reported around the world. Her
exuberant social and sporting lifestyle was changed by a traumatic
experience around 1910, when her daughter attempted to have her murdered
in order to inherit. In the middle of the night, in her own house, she
challenged the gang and they fled. Afterwards she devoted herself to
French government work in Morocco, and charitable works with animals,
disadvantaged women and orphans.A pioneer feminist, she served as
vice-president of the "Human Rights League "after World War I. In 1904

<h3 id="the-duke-of-westminsters-100000-olympic-games-appeal">The Duke
of Westminster’s £100,000 Olympic Games appeal</h3>
<div>
<p>The Olympic Games in 1916 were due to be held in Berlin, but
ultimately never took place because of the outbreak of World War I. This
book is part of a failed British fundraising appeal for those games -
and, somewhat counterintuitively, one of the most influential 20th
century sport books published in Britain. In the early 20th century, the
ethos in British sport was one of sportsmanship, fair play, playing for
the love of the game and the cult of the amateur. This was exemplified
by the London football team Corinthian F.C. who gave us the phrase the
Corinthian Spirit and took the ideal of sportsmanship to what now seem
like extremes. If Corinthian F.C. broke the gentleman’s code of
sportsmanship by fouling the opposition and giving them a penalty, their
goalkeeper would stand to one side and give the opposition a free shot
at goal. If they were awarded a penalty, the Corinthian captain would
deliberately kick the ball over the crossbar not wanting to take
advantage of an error by the other team. How you played was as
important, perhaps more important, than winning. The 20th century would
see a gradual erosion of amateurism in both British sport and the
Olympics. In 1913, calling someone an amateur would be a great
compliment - today it would be more likely to be taken as an insult.
This publication from 1913 is an important step in that change in
attitudes.</p>

<h3 id="the-tailteann-games---the-irish-olympics">The Tailteann Games -
the Irish Olympics</h3>
<div>
<p>he sporting championships we enjoy now have long, historical roots.
The modern Olympic Games were inspired by the Olympics of ancient
Greece, reviving and valorising competitions from a time before the
industrial and modern world. In Ireland, the Tailteann Games can be seen
to follow a similar path, reviving an ancient sporting tradition in
modern times. The Tailteann Games were a sport championships for Irish
people or those with Irish ancestry. They were held across Ireland in
1924, 1928 and 1932. In these years, Ireland had just won its
independence. The Tailteann Games were seen as a way to establish the
new Irish state, reviving an ancient sporting custom. In Bronze Age
Ireland, large sporting gatherings known as funeral games were held.
These were athletic competitions held to honour a recently deceased
person. The name Tailteann derives from one such event: the Aonach
Tailteann held in the townload of Teltown in County Meath. According to
the Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland, the fair was established by the
legendary king Lugh Lámhfhada in honour of his foster-mother,
Tailtiu.</p>

Olympiad - took place in Moscow in the Soviet Union, from 19 July to 3
August. These games were politically fraught, boycotted by
representatives of 63 countries as a result of the Soviet–Afghan War.
Following the inauguration of the Games at Łużniki Stadium, 5,217
athletes took part in 203 events, setting 36 world records, 39 European
records and 74 Olympic records. One of the most famous events taking
place at these Games was the pole vaulting competition - a track and
field event in which a person uses a long flexible pole as an aid to

<p>Se fino al termine del diciannovesimo secolo non esisteva l'obbligo
del tracciare la linea di metà campo , è il 1902 a vedere per la prima
volta comparire la linea mediana e, soprattutto, l'area di rigore con
annessa area di porta: questa serve per posizionare il pallone in caso
di calcio di rinvio; tuttavia, vigeva ancora la disposizione per la
quale il pallone deve essere posizionato nella metà di area di porta più
vicina a dove il pallone aveva oltrepassato la linea di porta uscendo
dal terreno di gioco. Il 1903 vede invece la nascita dei calci di
punizione diretti e della norma del vantaggio. Il 1904 conosce infine la
formazione della FIFA, che adotterà immediatamente le regole dell'IFAB
per le proprie gare e competizioni.\</p>
</div>
<h3 id="metà-900-2">-Metà 900</h3>
<div>
<p>Il nuovo decennio cominciò poi immediatamente con l'affermarsi del
calcio nel mondo grazie al campionato mondiale del 1930, organizzato
dalla FIFA in Uruguay e giocato interamente secondo le regole stilate
dall'IFAB sino ad allora; le modifiche importanti non furono molte in
quegli anni, ma nel 1937 fu incaricato Stanley Rous, all'epoca
segretario della FA, di rivedere le regole del gioco, rendendole più
sintetiche e dirette alla comprensione; Stanley preparò il testo
rivisto, mentre l'IFAB quell'anno approvò la comparsa sul terreno di
gioco dell'arco dell'area di rigore, e lo presentò all'IFAB l'anno dopo
, il quale lo approvò immediatamente. L'ultimo decennio fu segnato
ancora da ostilità che impedirono le riunioni dal 1940 al 1947 , ma già
dalla ripresa degli incontri ricominciarono le proposte: ad esempio, dal
1948, i calciatori, in occasione di un calcio di rinvio, devono anche
stare all'esterno dell'area di rigore e non più solo a 9,15 metri dal
pallone fino a che questo non torna ad essere in gioco.<br />

<p>La seconda metà del ventesimo secolo vede l'avvento della discussione
sulle sostituzioni: inizialmente l'IFAB si dimostrò riluttante
all'autorizzazione di effettuare sostituzioni in partite non amichevoli,
ma, dopo un decennio di tentennamenti, la decisione fu finalmente presa
nel 1958, sebbene all'epoca la sostituzione permessa fosse soltanto una,
per il portiere e solo in caso di infortunio.<br />
Durante il decennio successivo, tuttavia, le sostituzioni furono fissate
gradatamente e definitivamente a due indipendentemente dal ruolo.
Inizialmente ammesse solo per le gare amichevoli, le sostituzioni furono
infine consentite anche negli incontri ufficiali; il mondiale del 1970
in Messico fu il primo in cui furono ammesse le sostituzioni. Nel
mondiale del 1966 sia gli italiani che i brasiliani furono penalizzati
proprio dal fatto di non poter sostituire un giocatore importante
infortunato: Giacomo Bulgarelli nella partita persa contro la Corea del
Nord e Pelé nella partita persa contro il Portogallo.</p>
