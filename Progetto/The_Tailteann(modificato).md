
The sporting championships we enjoy now have long, historical roots. The
modern Olympic Games were inspired by the Olympics of ancient Greece,
reviving and valorising competitions from a time before the industrial
and modern world.
In Ireland, the Tailteann Games can be seen to follow a similar path,
reviving an ancient sporting tradition in modern times.
The Tailteann Games were a sport championships for Irish people or those
with Irish ancestry. They were held across Ireland in 1924, 1928 and
1932. In these years, Ireland had just won its independence. The
Tailteann Games were seen as a way to establish the new Irish state,
reviving an ancient sporting custom.
In Bronze Age Ireland, large sporting gatherings known as  were held. These
were athletic competitions held to honour a recently deceased person.
The name Tailteann derives from one such event: the Aonach Tailteann
 held in the townload of Teltown in County Meath.
According to the Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland, the fair was
established by the legendary king Lugh LÃ¡mhfhada  in honour of his foster-mother, Tailtiu.
