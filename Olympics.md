The Olympic Games - the biggest sports contest in the world - have
always drawn international interest and attention. Countless stories can
be told about the Olympics - of competition and championship, and also
of politics and identities.

The Olympic Games are thus a vital part of history. Let\'s travel back
in time to the 1920 Olympic Games, and learn the daily life of European
citizens and the aftermath of World War I in the early 1920s.

## How did sports and rules evolve at the 1920 Olympic Games?

Travelling back a century in time, things were of course very different
in the summer of 1920.

There were, for example, several disciplines included in the 1920
Olympic Games that no longer take place today, such as tug of war and
equestrian vaulting.

An interesting surprise was the inclusion of
[art](https://www.europeana.eu/stories?tags=art) as a separate
discipline in the agenda. Like the athletes participating in the Games,
architects, painters, sculptors, and musicians also had the chance to
receive medals with their sport-inspired artworks.

Nowadays, we are used to having the [Summer and Winter
Olympics](https://www.europeana.eu/stories?tags=olympic-games) as two
separate sports tournaments. But, in 1920, ice hockey and figure skating
were also included in the Antwerp Olympics alongside all the other
summer sports.

Taking place at the Ice Palace of Antwerp, the ice hockey tournament
marked the debut of the sport in the Olympics. It was also the only time
this winter sport appeared in a Summer Games - since 1924, it has been
part of the Winter Games.

We also see several rule changes relating to gender. Racewalking, for
instance, used to be reserved only for male athletes. It was not until
1992 that women were allowed to participate in this sport.

## How was life in 1920s Europe reflected at the 1920 Olympic Games?

While sports rules have often changed, the life of European people in
1920s sees many similarities with our activities today.

Just like today, the 1920s European public were also highly passionate
about [football](https://www.europeana.eu/stories?tags=football). The
final match of the 1920 Olympics football tournament, in which
Czechoslovakia played against host-country Belgium, attracted no less
than 50,000 spectators. Some of whom - failing to burst through the sea
of people - were even watching from outside the stadium.

We also know that drama and controversies are by no means something
recent in football history. Violent collision between players, and
dissatisfaction with referee decisions, were as major a part of football
as they are today.

During the 1920 Olympics, the Swedish team nearly withdrew from the
tournament in protest at the referee of their match against the
Netherlands. The team from Czechoslovakia also left the field in their
final match against Belgium, in opposition to a decisive penalty that
caused their loss.

That Belgian national football team was initially unpopular among the
Antwerp public due to the absence of players from Beerschot, the local
football club. The discontent was so great that it swayed the coach's
decision, and more Beerschot players were eventually added to the field.

Just like today, football reflects national, regional and local
identities and pride.

## What was the impact of World War I on the 1920 Olympic Games?

The 1920 Antwerp Olympics took place in a special historical context.
[World War I](https://www.europeana.eu/stories?tags=world-war-i) had
ended just nine months before, and European countries were still
struggling to rebuild their society after the destruction.

Most people at that time could not afford tickets to see these Olympic
Games. Football - many fan's favourite sport - was only the exception.

Like other cities in Belgium, Antwerp was badly damaged by the war. The
decision that it would host the 1920 Games came fairly late, giving it
less than a year for preparation. The rushed construction of the
stadium, its incomplete state when the Games began, and debts that the
organising committee had to bear\... all testified to the difficulties
resulting from the war.

However, World War I was also a reason why Antwerp had been chosen as
the host city for the Olympics. This choice was to reward
[Belgium](https://www.europeana.eu/stories?tags=belgium) for its bravery
and perseverance during the war. This was reflected in the architecture
of the stadium, whose entrance featured a soldier holding a grenade,
instead of a traditional discus thrower.
