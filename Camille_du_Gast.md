**Camille du Gast** (**Marie Marthe Camille Desinge du Gast**, **Camille Crespin du Gast**, 30 May 1868 – 24 April 1942)[[1]](#cite_note-Ford-1) was one of a trio of pioneering French female motoring celebrities of the *[Belle Epoque](/wiki/Belle_Epoque "Belle Epoque")*, together with Hélène de Rothschild (Baroness [Hélène van Zuylen](/wiki/H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne_van_Zuylen "Hélène van Zuylen")) and [Anne de Rochechouart de Mortemart](/wiki/Anne_de_Rochechouart_de_Mortemart "Anne de Rochechouart de Mortemart") the ([Duchess of Uzès](/wiki/Viscounts_and_Dukes_of_Uz%C3%A8s "Viscounts and Dukes of Uzès")).[[Note 1]](#cite_note-3)[[3]](#cite_note-4)[[4]](#cite_note-5)

Du Gast was known as "one of the richest and most accomplished widows in France," and as an accomplished sportswoman—a balloonist, parachute jumper, fencer, tobogganist, skier, rifle and pistol shot, horse trainer—as well as a concert pianist and singer. She was the second woman to compete in an international motor race.[[1]](#cite_note-Ford-1)[[5]](#cite_note-Buisseret-6)[[6]](#cite_note-Lachaise-7)[[7]](#cite_note-York-8)

In France, she later became renowned for her extensive charity work. She was president of the *Société protectrice des animaux* (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, *SPA*) until her death, and her campaign against bullfighting included disruptive [direct action](/wiki/Direct_action "Direct action") protests. She provided health-care to disadvantaged women and children in Paris, and continued whilst under German occupation in World War II.[[1]](#cite_note-Ford-1)[[6]](#cite_note-Lachaise-7)

She was the central figure in the Parisian scandal of *La Femme au Masque* where she was maliciously but mistakenly named as the nude model in a notorious painting by [Henri Gervex](/wiki/Henri_Gervex "Henri Gervex"). This salacious story involved three court cases, and was reported around the world.[[7]](#cite_note-York-8)[[8]](#cite_note-Cauvin-9)[[9]](#cite_note-FastLads-10)[[10]](#cite_note-Auckland_20_09_02-11)

Her exuberant social and sporting lifestyle was changed by a traumatic experience around 1910, when her daughter attempted to have her murdered in order to inherit. In the middle of the night, in her own house, she challenged the gang and they fled. Afterwards she devoted herself to French government work in Morocco, and charitable works with animals, disadvantaged women and orphans.[[9]](#cite_note-FastLads-10)

A pioneer feminist, she served as vice-president of the [Ligue Française du Droit des Femmes](/wiki/Human_Rights_League_(France) "Human Rights League (France)") (The French League for the Rights of Women) after World War I.[[8]](#cite_note-Cauvin-9) In 1904 she became the only woman official of the [Automobile Club de France](/wiki/Automobile_Club_de_France "Automobile Club de France") (A.C.F.).

She was known in the press by the [sobriquets](/wiki/Sobriquet "Sobriquet") *[l'Amazone](/wiki/Amazons "Amazons")* and *la Walkyrie de la Mécanique* *([Valkyrie](/wiki/Valkyrie "Valkyrie") of the motor car)*.[[1]](#cite_note-Ford-1)[[6]](#cite_note-Lachaise-7)
